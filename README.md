# Crystal-Collector ‚ú®

In this game the user will be given a random number that they are trying to reach by clicking the crystals at the bottom of the page. Each crystal has a hidden value that will only be revealed once it is clicked and added to the score. The goal is to reach the exact score given at the beginning of the game. Going over will count as a loss. Once user has lost game will automatically restart. Total wins and losses will add up until page is refreshed.
